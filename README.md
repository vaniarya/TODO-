# ✅ JavaFX TODO App

A modern **To-Do List Application** built in **JavaFX**, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks with due dates. Tasks are saved permanently using Java's object serialization so they persist between sessions.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📝 Add tasks with descriptions and due dates
- 👀 View all tasks with checkboxes and delete buttons
- 📜 Scrollable task list layout using `VBox` and `ScrollPane`
- 🎨 Styled with colors, fonts, and image-based buttons
